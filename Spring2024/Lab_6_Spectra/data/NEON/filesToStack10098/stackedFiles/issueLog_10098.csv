This guidance was inconsistent with the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987), which instructs to measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals if at least one stem has basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. Because guidance not consistent with the protocol was followed, plots sampled at MOAB in the affected date range included approximately 10 fewer small, multi-stem shrubs per plot than if the Vegetation Structure protocol guidance were followed. Measuring fewer individuals per plot means that per plot biomass and volume estimates for the ‘small shrub’ growth form are lower for 2023 than for other years.","Qualification criteria for cover assessment and measurement of small, multi-stem shrub individuals (i.e., growth form = ‘small shrub’) were reverted to those documented in the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987)."

When Tower plots are sampled for Vegetation Structure, a ‘towerSubset’ of n=5 plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of plots are sampled every 5 years. Prior to 2020, the five annually sampled towerSubset plots were determined using only spatial balance criteria, and at some sites, this resulted in over- or under-representation of NLCD vegetation classes relative to the full complement of Tower plots. From 2020 onward, spatial balance and NLCD representation criteria were used to select the annually sampled towerSubset plots, and a Plot Prioritization list was distributed to communicate the change. However, implementation of the change was not immediate at some sites, and the actual annual towerSubset sampled at affected sites differed from the Plot Prioritization list for at least one sampling year in the affected date range. The deviation from the Plot Prioritization list means that biomass and productivity estimates derived from the towerSubset plots at affected sites may not be as representative as possible of the full complement of Tower plots. For the PUUM site the issue was slightly different; at PUUM, deviations in spatial balance occurred to better coordinate Vegetation Structure sampling in the annual Tower subset with soil sampling, and these deviations were not documented in the approved Plot Prioritization list.","For the site-specific resolution dates identified below, annual sampling for Vegetation Structure in the towerSubset occurs in plots identified by spatial balance and NLCD vegetation type criteria, and annually sampled plots are consistent with the Plot Prioritization list. At the D20 PUUM site, all plots have the same NLCD type (i.e., evergreen forest), and a slight deviation from the spatially-balanced Plot Prioritization list was approved for Vegetation Structure sampling to enable spatial coordination with soil sampling (DP1.10086.001), which is constrained by soil depth in some plots due to relatively recent lava flow.
