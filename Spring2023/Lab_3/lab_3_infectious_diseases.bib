	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
          
            Appearing at the end of 2019, a novel virus (later identified as {SARS}-{CoV}-2) was characterized in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. As of the time of writing, the disease caused by this virus (known as {COVID}-19) has already resulted in over 3 million deaths worldwide. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections and deaths, however, have been highly unevenly distributed among age groups, sexes, countries, and jurisdictions over the course of the pandemic. Herein, I present a tool (the
            covid19.Explorer
            R package and web application) that has been designed to explore and analyze publicly available United States {COVID}-19 infection and death data from the 2020/21 U.S. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic. The analyses and visualizations that this R package and web application facilitate can help users better comprehend the geographic progress of the pandemic, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as lockdowns and other measures, which have varied widely among U.S. states), and the relative risks posed by {COVID}-19 to different age groups within the U.S. population. The end result is an interactive tool that will help its users develop an improved understanding of the temporal and geographic dynamics of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic, accessible to lay people and scientists alike.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Accurate estimates of the burden of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection are critical to informing pandemic response. Confirmed {COVID}-19 case counts in the U.S. do not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability. Here, we use a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy. We estimate 6,454,951 cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9\% vs. 0.2\% of the population) in the United States as of April 18, 2020. Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections during this period was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86\% (simulation interval: 64--99\%) of this difference is due to incomplete testing, while 14\% (0.3--36\%) is due to imperfect test accuracy. The approach can readily be applied in future studies in other locations or at finer spatial scale to correct for biased testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy to provide a more realistic assessment of {COVID}-19 burden.},
