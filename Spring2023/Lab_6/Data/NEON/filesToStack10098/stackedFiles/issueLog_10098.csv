However, since 2020 ferns are only scheduled for sampling every 5 years in Tower plots, and thus ferns are no longer measured in four out of five years in annually sampled Tower plots. For annually sampled Tower plots where ferns are the only 'other' type of growth form, the reported totalSampledAreaOther value suggested no fern biomass for four out of five years, when in fact ferns simply were not sampled for those years. Moreover, in annually sampled Tower plots where ferns coexist with some of the ‘other’ growth forms (e.g., palms in D03, xerophyllum in D16, tree ferns in D20), we reported a totalSampledAreaOther value for the ‘other’ growth forms that were measured annually, and for four out of five years we created the impression that zero fern biomass was legitimately measured, even though ferns were not scheduled for sampling.","Introduced new ‘nestedSubplotAreaFerns’ and ‘totalSampledAreaFerns’ fields in the vst_perplotperyear table to account for fern measurement separately from remaining ‘other’ growth forms.
